# Slack-2.0
Slack 2.0 is an iOS 11 chat app written in Swift (Obj-C for SWRevealViewControllers) that utilizes different channels to host conversations and allow users to chat instantaneously in real-time thanks to SocketIO. The chat API is built on NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to allow users to authenticate, create channels and chat! All API code and MongoDB are hosted through Heroku. The app pays close attention to great UI and UX with help of many Swift skills, Cocoapods, best practices and most importantly follows the MVC pattern.
